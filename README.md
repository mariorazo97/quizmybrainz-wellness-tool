## 🎯 Overview

**Body & Mind Detective** is a single-file HTML application that provides two distinct assessment pathways:

1. **Student "Body Detective" Quiz** - A child-friendly interoception assessment using emoji-based responses
2. **Teacher/Project Leader Burnout Check** - A professional assessment for high-functioning burnout detection

The tool translates complex neurophysiological concepts into actionable, accessible interventions based on peer-reviewed research in stress regulation and sensory integration.

## ✨ Features

### For Students (Ages 5-11)
- **4 Body Awareness Questions** covering:
  - Fuel Gauge (hunger/satiety)
  - Energy Speed (muscle state/arousal level)
  - Safety Meter (breathing/chest sensations)
  - Brain Weather (emotional state)
- **Emoji-Based Interface** for intuitive, age-appropriate responses
- **Personalized Recommendations** including:
  - Heavy work activities (wall pushes for hyper-arousal)
  - Deep pressure techniques (burrito squeeze for anxiety)
  - Hydration and rest protocols (for depletion)
- **Breathing Bubble Animation** - 8-second guided breathing cycle for immediate regulation

### For Teachers & Project Leaders
- **5 Evidence-Based Questions** detecting hidden burnout markers:
  - Sensory Gating Failure
  - Revenge Bedtime Procrastination
  - Fawn Response ("Yes" Reflex)
  - Dissociative Auto-Pilot
  - Anhedonia (emotional numbness)
- **Intensity Sliders** for nuanced self-assessment
- **Risk Stratification** (Low/Moderate/High)
- **Recovery Toolkit** with three expandable strategy cards:
  1. **Vagus Nerve Reset** - Cold water stimulation protocol
  2. **Delay Script** - Boundary-setting communication framework
  3. **Eisenhower Matrix** - Task prioritization methodology
- **Scientific Resources** - Direct links to peer-reviewed sources

## 🎨 Design System

- **Color Palette**: Golden (#D4AF37, #C5A000) with red-orange accents (#FF4500)
- **Background**: Warm cream (#F9F7F2) to reduce eye strain
- **Typography**: Crimson Pro (display) + DM Sans (body) for high legibility
- **Effects**: Glassmorphism with backdrop blur, smooth CSS transitions (0.4s)
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with adaptive layouts
